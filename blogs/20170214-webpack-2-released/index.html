Of course, i already updated this site and there were no bigger issues. The only thing that caused me a little bit of trouble was the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-loader>tslint-loader</a> which was included as a <code>preLoader</code>. Unfortunately, <code>preLoaders</code> are no longer supported by webpack 2. But the solution is easy: Just include it as a normal <code>rule</code> and set <code>enforce</code> to <code>&#39;pre&#39;</code>.</p> <pre><code class=lang-js>{
  test: /\.tsx?$/,
  loader: &#39;tslint-loader&#39;,
  enforce: &#39;pre&#39;,
  options: {
    emitErrors: true
  }
}
</code></pre> </div></div><hr/></div></div></div></body></html>
