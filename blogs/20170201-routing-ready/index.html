Just click on a title to check it out. It was a little bit tricky to make everything work with pre-rendering but of course, I got it working after fiddling around for a bit.</p> <p>On the webpack side, you must pass all possible paths to the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin>static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a>:</p> <pre><code class=lang-js>const paths = [
  &#39;/&#39;,
  ...path.allPaths
];

plugins: [
  new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin(&#39;app&#39;, paths)
]
</code></pre> <p>Then, on the React site, you can compose the correct content for every path:</p> <pre><code class=lang-ts>export default function (locals: { path: string }) {
  const html = (
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39; type=&#39;text/css&#39; href=&#39;/app.css&#39; /&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        {getContentForPath(locals.path)}
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  );

  return renderToStaticMarkup(html);
}
</code></pre> <p><code>getContentForPath(locals.path)</code> performs a very primitive routing to compose the content but i plan to use a library for this in future.</p> <p>I am very happy to see this work now because this is something a had in mind for quite some time. But I only have so much spare time to fiddle around with this stuff, you know.</p> </div></div><hr/></div></div></div></body></html>
