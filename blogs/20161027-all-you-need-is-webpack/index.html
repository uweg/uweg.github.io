In fact, all you need is Visual Studio Code and a couple of JavaScript libraries. For this blog, i use the following libraries:</p> <ul> <li>React: This gives me the opportunity to add a little HTML to the site without actually writing HTML. Let&#39;s be honest: Why should i write in a language that gives me just nothing when I also could have TypeScript?</li> <li>Webpack: Webpack is really great. Just add the right loaders and your website is being built for you.</li> </ul> <p>Thats about everything for now. This website looks really simple but it has all you need for a simple blog. The next step will probable be to add a little more awesomeness in terms of a better looking UI to it. After that, i will probably add routing to provide Urls that are a little bit more meaningful than no Url at all.</p> </div></div><hr/></div></div></div></body></html>
