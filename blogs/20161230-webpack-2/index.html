<p>Since <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack 2</a> will be released soon (currently the are shipping version <code>2.2.0-rc.3</code>), i fiddled around with it a little bit. It does practically the same thing as the old version but of course, it is improved in many points. The feature i heard most about is &quot;tree-shaking&quot; which removes all unused code from the generated bundle.</p>
<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>I have set up many projects with webpack 1 and the migration to webpack 2 is not very hard. The API of the configuration file is a little bit different but the documentation is good enough to make the process straightforward. I created a little project to point out the differences:</p>
<p>Webpack 1 configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">module.exports = {
  entry: &#39;./app.tsx&#39;,
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, &#39;dist&#39;),
    filename: &#39;bundle.js&#39;
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: &#39;ts&#39; },
    ]
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Webpack 2 configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">module.exports = {
  entry: &#39;./app.tsx&#39;,
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, &#39;dist&#39;),
    filename: &#39;bundle.js&#39;
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(ts|tsx)$/, use: &#39;ts-loader&#39; }
    ]
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>In this primitive example, only the usage of the loaders is different.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>I used the same TypeScript code in both projects:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-typescript">import * as React from &#39;react&#39;;
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from &#39;react-dom/server&#39;;

const app = &lt;div&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;;
console.log(renderToStaticMarkup(app));
</code></pre>
<p>This is a simple React application that writes some markup to the command line. Now, lets compile it in webpack 1:</p>
<pre><code>Version: webpack 1.14.0
Time: 5015ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  219 kB       0  [emitted]  main
</code></pre><p>And then in webpack 2:</p>
<pre><code>Version: webpack 2.2.0-rc.3
Time: 3987ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  138 kB       0  [emitted]  main
</code></pre><p>So, while the compile time was reduced, the bundle size is also 37% smaller. This is very impressive because all the used libraries are the same and all i had to do was to use the new webpack version. I&#39;m looking forward to use webpack 2 on a bigger project (but i think i&#39;ll wait until the final version comes out).</p>
