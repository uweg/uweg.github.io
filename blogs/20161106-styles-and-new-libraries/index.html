I like it pretty much and it has all the features needed to style a website properly. Also, the webpack integration is really good; there is an extra <a href="https://github.com/webpack/less-loader">loader</a> for it that does all the work.</p>
<p>I added this to the <code>loaders</code> section of my webpack configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{ test: /\.less$/, loader: &#39;style!css!less&#39; }
</code></pre>
<p>This means, all LESS files are first converted to CSS and then passed to the other webpack loaders to do their magic. There are not much styles yet but at least, everything is ready to add them.</p>
<h2 id="and-libraries">And libraries</h2>
<p>If you know me, you might also know that i like the <a href="http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/">MobX</a> library. It provides a reactive approach to programming with React and is very close to <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>. Further, i added <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react">mobx-react</a> that connects MobX with React. Now i&#39;m ready to add some more advanced features to the site.</p>
