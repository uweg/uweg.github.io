Luckily, there is some help in sight with TypeScript 2.1 coming soon. On the <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap>roadmap</a>, the feature <em><a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/188>Completions in imports and triple-slash reference paths</a></em> is announced. I did not test it yet because it doesn&#39;t seem to be available in the release candidate but at least it sounds promising.</p> <h2 id=typescript-hero>TypeScript Hero</h2> <p>Since i&#39;m not the only one with this problem, there are a number of plugins available for various IDEs out there to address the problem. I tested a few of them but most doesn&#39;t seem to work very well. In the end, i sticked with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero">TypeScript Hero</a> which does its job good enough for me.</p> <p>After installation of the plugin, Visual Studio Code behaves close to what i am used from C#. Just type the name of the asset you need and the plugin will suggest you the according file to include.</p> <p><img src=cbd0469390df0f25d3e82ba25ffb84e6.png alt="A fitting import is being suggested"></p> <p>This saves a lot of work and in most cases, it works quite well. However, sometimes it refuses to find some of my imports and I don&#39;t really know what the reason for this might be. In such a situation, it can help to rebuild the cache of the plugin.</p> <p>I highly recommend this plugin for everyone that uses TypeScript on a regular basis because it saves some serious time. And maybe (hopefully), it even will no longer be needed because TypeScript 2.1 brings the functionality by itself.</p> </div></div><hr/></div></div></div></body></html>
