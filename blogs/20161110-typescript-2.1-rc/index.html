Of course, i had to check it out and play with it. There are some new features i waited for like async / await for ES5 or better type inference.</p> <h2 id=better-usage-of-implicit-any>Better usage of implicit any</h2> <p>When you don&#39;t disable the use implicit any types, TypeScript will now infer the type based on whats later assigned to the value. This also works for arrays.</p> <pre><code class=lang-typescript>let test = [];
// test has type any[]

test.push(1);
// test has type number[]

test.push(&#39;a&#39;);
// test has type (number|string)[]
</code></pre> <p>If you assign a new value to the variable, it will have the new type. This should reduce the number of &#39;implicit any&#39; errors and reduce the need to provide a type to new variables if you do not assign a value immediately.</p> <h2 id=async-await-in-es5>Async / await in ES5</h2> <p>This is something i waited for a long time and finally it&#39;s here! I hope that it gets now easier to write asynchronous code and also reduce the complexity.</p> <p>We do have this for a while now in C# and it&#39;s quite handy to use. Also i can think of a couple of examples in some projects i work on where it would make my life a lot easier. Of course i will have to wait for the final version of TypeScript 2.1.</p> </div></div></div></div></body></html>
