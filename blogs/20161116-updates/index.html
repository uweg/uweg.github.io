The biggest change is the one from React 15.3.2 to react 15.4.0 which was <a href=https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/11/16/react-v15.4.0.html>announced</a> today. None of the changes do really affect my website but i love to see that it&#39;s going forward.</p> <p>Also, i had some thoughts about routing in the last days. Since github pages (where this page is hosted on) doesn&#39;t support redirects, it is a little bit hard to make a single page application. I think my approach will be to pre-render everything with webpack and then deploy just the HTML files. To make this happen, i will have to put in a bit of investigation in this direction. I hope that i&#39;ll get to it soon.</p> </div></div></div></div></body></html>
