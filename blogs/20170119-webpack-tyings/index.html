<p>Today, i finally found the official TypeScript type definitions for the webpack client side runtime: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/webpack-env">@types/webpack-env</a>. Before, i always wrote my own little <code>.d.ts</code> file which is no longer needed now. Of course, i was quite sure that some sort of typings must exist out there but i just was too lazy to search for it. For the code of this website, there was just a little change needed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ts">// before:
const styles: {
  header: string,
  title: string,
  subtitle: string
} = require(&#39;./Header.less&#39;);

//after:
const styles = require&lt;{
  header: string,
  title: string,
  subtitle: string
}&gt;(&#39;./Header.less&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p><code>require</code> now has a generic return value instead of returning just <code>any</code>. This doesn&#39;t bring any real benefit but of course, it&#39;s always nice to &quot;do it the right way&quot;.</p>
