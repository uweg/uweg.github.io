This means that the code of the website is executed at build-time and only the ready-made HTML is served to the client later. This speeds up the rendering of the page in the client, because the browser only has to process the HTML (and not tons of JavaScript).</p> <p>For this site, this means that 448KB of JavaScript are replaced with roughly 20KB of HTML. I did not measure loading time but it sure is much faster. The only drawback is, that the configuration is a little bit harder to get right. But since my website currently has no routes, it was not too hard. Of course, there is also a webpack plugin for this: <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin>static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a>. It is well documented and also has some popularity; two main criteria to select a JavaScript framework.</p> <p>First of all, the entry point of the website must return a function that returns the rendered HTML:</p> <pre><code class=lang-TS>export default function () {
  const html = (
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39; type=&#39;text/css&#39; href=&#39;app.less&#39; /&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body style={{ margin: 0 }}&gt;
        {website.getElement()}
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  );

  return renderToStaticMarkup(html);
}
</code></pre> <p>&#39;renderToStaticMarkup&#39; is functionality of the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom>react-dom</a> module. As a little bonus, now even the <code>index.html</code> is checked by the TypeScript compiler. Then, the webpack configuration must be adjusted. Set the library target to <code>umd</code>:</p> <pre><code class=lang-TS>output: {
  path: &#39;dist&#39;,
  filename: &#39;[name].js&#39;,
  libraryTarget: &#39;umd&#39;
}
</code></pre> <p>And add the new plugin to the plugins array:</p> <pre><code class=lang-TS>plugins: [
  // ...
  new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin(&#39;app&#39;, paths)
]
</code></pre> <p><code>paths</code> is an array of all paths; in my case just <code>[&#39;/&#39;]</code>. Of course, my example is very trivial but i think this approach will also scale to bigger sites.</p> </div></div></div></div></body></html>
