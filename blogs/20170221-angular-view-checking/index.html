In the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap">TypeScript roadmap</a>, a feature called <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/12231">Language Service Extensibility</a> is announced for the upcoming version 2.3 which is a way to add custom features to the language with plugins. This was discussed for a long time but finally, it seems to be happening.</p>
<p>Until now, the only way to check Angular templates for errors was using a tool or editor plugin that parses the template and tries to find errors. This works ok but it never felt right to me because template were not a real part of the source code like for example with React (tsx). Interestingly, this was not a big concern for many people and so it took way too long to make this happen.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/13716">corresponding issue</a> on the Angular issue tracker and in the discussion, an <a href="https://github.com/RyanCavanaugh/angular2-seed">example project</a> is linked that show cases the new feature. I tried it and in fact, it seems to work.</p>

<p>Finally, Angular templates feel like a part of the code and not just some pile of error prone HTML snippets. Of course, everything of this is not ready for production yet but it seems to go in the right direction. With this ready, I think I will no longer refuse to use Angular in a real project as i did until now.</p>
